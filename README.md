# C++ Basic Introduction:
 C++ Basic Programming Introduction for Arduino Users

This repository is designed for Arduino learners who are new to C++ programming.  
It provides a gentle and well-commented introduction to the core concepts of programming using standard C++ syntax.

# Topics Covered:

Each file is structured to focus on one key programming concept:

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 01_hello_world.cpp | What is Programming? - Basic structure, `main()`, `cout`, and `return 0` |
| 02_variables_io.cpp | Variables, Data Types, and Input/Output - Using `cin`, `cout`, and simple math |
| 03_conditionals.cpp | Conditional Statements - `if`, `if-else`, `else if`, and multiple checks |
| 04_functions.cpp | Functions - Writing reusable blocks of code with and without parameters |
| 05_loops.cpp | Loops - Repeating actions using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops |
| 06_arduino-intro.cpp | An introduction to Arduino basic required functions |

# How to Use:
We can use any Code Editor in our machine to run and test our cpp code, using PythonTutor which is a fantastic tool for helping students visualize code execution, especially for beginners:
1. Go to the [PythonTutor link](https://pythontutor.com/cpp.html).
2. Write or paste the C++ code into the editor.
3. Click "Visualize Execution" button.
4. Use "Next" and "Prev" to step through the code line by line.
5. Observe how variables and memory change over time.
